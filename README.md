Anomaly detection gas sensor arrays is a project to showcase the utility of the support vector data description (SVDD) by using the python package, scikit-learn, in the julia programming language to make an anomaly detector for a gas sensor array. Via simulation, we demonstrate with (1) a hypothetical sensor array composed of two gravimetric sensors utilizing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks and (2) a synthetic (gas composition, sensor array response) data set pertaining to gas sensing in a fruit ripening room, where (a) CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, and H$_2$O vary in concentration and (b) anomalies are defined with respect to CO$_2$ and C$_2$H$_4$ concentrations.


## Usage

```julia

# returns 'words'
#foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
#foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
#foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
